# FreeCAD Model

My original CAD models were incomplete, but I remodeled the pad in 2024. I believe the parts and placement are accurate, but it's possible there are some mistakes.

Some tools are missing for now.
* 3D printed hook and loop fastener aligners
* 3D printed strut spacers
* 3D printed standoff spacers

fsr-dance-pad.FCStd contains links to files in the parts-and-subassemblies folder. If you download fsr-dance-pad.FCStd without also downloading the parts-and-subassemblies and all its contents to the same parent folder, it will not display properly when opened.

It should work in FreeCAD 0.21.0 or newer.
