I have interlocking EVA foam tiles under my pad that used to be a kid's play mat. I also tried feet made from rubber bumpers held on with screws and t nuts. They were a bit difficult to install once the frame was assembled. The stock RE:Flex leveling feet should fit if you can find them. Or a tnutz representative suggested using rubber tread strip on the bottom, which I bet would work fine ( [https://www.tnutz.com/product/bum-015-ts/](https://www.tnutz.com/product/bum-015-ts/) ). Anything that people suggest putting an arcade pad on would probably work (horse stall mats?).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The metal panels do look extremely cool though. Aluminum needs to be painted or anodized in order to keep black aluminum oxide dust from rubbing off on your socks or shoes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Dual lock are symmetric so you will need 72 pieces to fit in the 36 corners of 9 panels. For Velcro or generic hook and loop, you will need 36 hook and 36 loop pieces. I ordered these generic ones: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08G873CGJ They were cheap and work OK but the adhesive isn't good enough and eventually they start to gradually slide out of place. 3M Dual Lock is great but quite a bit more expensive. Small note, regular size Dual Lock is thicker than Velcro (about 5mm mated). The "low-profile" Dual Lock is about the same thickness as Velcro (about 3mm mated), but is harder to find, may be more expensive, and can be damaged pretty easily. I also tried https://www.itapestore.com/velcro-brand-hook-or-loop-coins-with-72-high-temp-adhesive-three-quarter-inch which seem to have a nice quality adhesive but I haven't tested them enough to say if they're worth the price. If I ever redesign the mounts, a likely change will be to use bigger hook and loop dots. |

Teensy 4.1 is well-supported by Teejusb's FSR firmware and has enough analog inputs to do 16 independent sensor inputs. It is plenty fast enough to control lots of colorful lights. If you want to save a few dollars, a Pro Micro clone (e.g. https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32840365436.html) is a valid choice with 9 analog pins but not fast enough to do much with addressable RGB LEDs. It could handle some simple on/off LEDs, or about 4 WS2812 LEDs without impacting gamepad performance. RP2040-based boards can be a good cheap option. They only have 4 analog pins but are fast enough to do a lot of addressable LEDs. Be aware that the Pi Pico and Pi Pico W only expose 3 analog input pins. The Waveshare RP2040-Zero (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006031224378.html) is one example of a cheap, small RP2040 board with 4 analog pins.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
