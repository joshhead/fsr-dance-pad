# STEP Files

These are easier to edit than STLs when modifying parts, and more universal than FreeCAD files. If you use FreeCAD, check the [freecad](../freecad) folder also.

The STL files covered by each STEP file are listed below. Mirrored STLs are based on the non-mirrored versions. The STLs in the stl folder are oriented for printing, but the STEP files may not be.
